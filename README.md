# bose-macos-utility
A simple macOS utility that can be used to control the behaviour of Bose QC35 Headphones straight from the menu bar.

## Why
Have you ever tried to connect your bose headphones to both your Macbook, iPhone and iPad, and then seamlessly switch between the devices? Or are you using the 'command button' on the left side of your headphones to trigger Google Assistant or Alexa and you suddenly want to change the level of noise cancellation, but your phone is so far away that it would require you to stand up and walk towards it? Yeah, I know your pain. I've been there too. Since the only two officially supported platforms for the Bose official app that can be used to control the headphones are iOS and Android, using them with any other platform is kind of a pain. This small app tries to fix this, by giving you the functionality (hopeto be fully supported at some point) to control your headphones directly from the menu bar.

## How I figured it out
I have always wanted to learn something more about more low level stuff regarding bluetooth technology, so this seemed like a nice side project that I could work on. After hours of staring at the packets sniffed while using the official app on my iPhone and after countless fights with the 'not-so-well' documented bluetooth api of macOS I figured what needs to be done to control the headphones. At some point I will probably upload a guide on how I reversed the protocol.
